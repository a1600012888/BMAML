# BMAML
Re-implement of Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning



Work in progress...

* hyper-param tuning(nearly done)
* Contrast with MAML
* visualization of predictions
* Experiemnts on other dataset
* update README...


* For the full pipeline of continious adaptation, go to con.baseline.  
* con.nornn:  Removes the rnn kernel from the full pipeline
* con.baseline.stop:  Stop the gradient of history particles in rnn kernel
* con.Bmaml.eq:   BMAML
